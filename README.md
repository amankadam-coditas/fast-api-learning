This repository is a collection of examples, projects, and notes for learning FastAPIâ€”a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Features

- FastAPI basics and advanced usage
- Example projects and code snippets
- Explanations and documentation for each feature
- Best practices for API development

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amankadam-coditas/fast-api-learning.git
   cd fast-api-learning
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

4. **Run a sample FastAPI project:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   (Replace `main:app` with your FastAPI application's entrypoint)
